## Introduction

Information about the latest available policy gates, triggers and parameters can be retrieved from a running anchore-engine, using the anchore-cli command below:

`# anchore-cli policy describe (--gate <gatename> ( --trigger <triggername))`

For an independent list of available gates/triggers, refer to [Anchore Policy Checks]({{< ref "/docs/overview/concepts/policy/policy_checks" >}})
